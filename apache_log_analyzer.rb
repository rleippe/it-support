# Apache2 log analyzer to count unique ips and number of queries
#
# This script is used to find the unique ips in an apache2 access.log
# and count the number of queries for each ip, the number of errors served
# and the number of queries to secret.html for each ip.

#   ApacheLogAnalyzer: Analyzer for a log file given the full or relative path
#
# Apache2 log analyzer
#
#  Build an instance of this class and pass a list of full or relative path(s)
#  to the analyze function to receive a list of unique IP addresses, the total
#  number of queries per IP, the number of queries to secret.html per IP, and
#  the total number of 404 errors served.
